This took about an hour and a half to build out from scratch.  I used the code demo from yesterday as a guide and changed things to have the required parameters for this assignment.  The biggest challenge was deciding how to have each page have 2 actions, specifically what those actions should be.  I learned to use the \n line break really well.
